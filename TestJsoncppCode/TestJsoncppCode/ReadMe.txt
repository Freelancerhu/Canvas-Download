    CONSOLE APPLICATION : TestJsoncppCode Project Overview
========================================================================


This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your TestJsoncppCode application.


TestJsoncppCode.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features.

TestJsoncppCode.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
I have created the following resources:

TestJsoncppCode.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named TestJsoncppCode.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
